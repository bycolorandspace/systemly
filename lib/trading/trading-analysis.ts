  return `ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Identify timeframe, trend direction and strength
2. Assess all visible technical indicators and patterns
3. Find key support/resistance levels with precision
4. Evaluate momentum, volume, and market structure
5. Score setup components objectively (0-100 scale)
6. Provide specific entry/exit strategies
7. Calculate position sizing and risk management

SCORING METHODOLOGY:
- Trend Strength (25%): Direction clarity and momentum
- Risk/Reward (20%): Ratio quality and target probability  
- Volume (15%): Volume supports price action (0 if not visible)
- Technical Setup (15%): Pattern quality and reliability
- Market Structure (10%): Key levels and market health
- Timing (10%): Entry timing optimization
- Volatility (5%): Environment suitability

CRITICAL ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be specific with price levels, not vague ranges
- Only suggest trades with favorable risk/reward (minimum 1:2)
- If no good setup exists, clearly state "wait" or "no trade"
- Consider position sizing relative to account risk
- Focus on what traders can ACT on immediately
- Be honest with scores - don't inflate them. Most setups score 60-75
- Only exceptional setups should score 85+
- Calculate the overall score using the weighted breakdown
- Provide specific reasoning for each score component

FAIL-SAFE REQUIREMENTS:
- If volume data is NOT visible: Set volume score to 0 and state "Volume data not visible on this chart"
- If timeframe cannot be determined: State "Timeframe unclear from chart"
- If price levels are illegible: State "Price levels not clearly visible"
- If chart type is unclear: State "Chart type/format unclear"
- If indicators are present but unreadable: Note which indicators are visible but uninterpretable
- Always include "dataLimitations" array listing what's missing or unclear
- If multiple critical elements are missing, recommend against trading

4. All string arrays should have 1-4 items maximum
5. If data not visible, use "N/A" or "Not visible"
6. Ensure all numbers are actual numbers, not strings
7. Use double quotes throughout
8. No trailing commas anywhere
9. Calculate overall score using weighted breakdown
10. Be honest with scores - most setups score 60-80
